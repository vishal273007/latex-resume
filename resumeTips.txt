Resume Tips
===========

Resume section weightage
Project (40%) > Experience (30% if applicable) > Skills (20%) >>> remaining (10%)


Content is KING: Fix keywords/impact first (or ATS/recruiters may ignore you). Appearance is secondary: Tiny spacing issues won’t matter if your content is strong.


Get used to updating your resume according to job post description.
let me tell you a secret:
- I never used the same resume twice.
- I edited it for every job description.
Hiring managers don’t want a “Best Resume”, They want the right one.

Average Interview is of 45 mins (35 Min -- 60 Min) long. Interviewer cannot touch every topic. So prepare focusing only on most commonly asked interview questions.


Forgetting is a natural human tendency, which is why we need to regularly revise.





In a usual seen job post competition where success rate is 1 in 1100, update project for each job post like this - 

1. Project description update to same project
2. Skill keyword priority update according to jop description exactly 
3. Professional summary update with exact job post description

Just copy paste the keywords in these sections but not blindly using an AI assistant.







With weak DSA, forget about Product Based Companies.




=================================================================

List only easy projects that you can explain well in the Projects

Projects section
================

Problem → Solution → Impact in every bullet / did X with Y for Z

Description must have (one line with bullet point)  
 - What did you do/Problem? 
	Designed a GUI-based system to manage student records.
 - How did you do it/Action?
	Implemented CRUD operations for adding, updating, and deleting student data.
	Integrated MySQL for secure database storage.
 - What was the impact/Result? (by how many % amount impact)
	Reduced manual record-keeping time by 30% for college staff.

use max 3 bullet points to mention if needed.

Use clear, descriptive title  (e.g., "E-Commerce Website")

After the project description, place "Tech Stack (layered : frontend, backend, dB) >> Technologies Used(simpler-only one programming lang used)".

Logical Flow: Project title → description/impact → technologies.

Make an excel sheet to manage job application progress, like application date, follow-up date, etc.

Content → Sentence case (Built a responsive portfolio website using JavaScript.)


Use contact info with embedded link and show only platform name. Like GitHub | LinkedIn with link embedded. Avoid username and full URL.


Contact sorting order -> Email, Phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, Location

Use current residence Hyderabad where you are now, Gorakhpur is only required in Full permanent address.

Short college name is perfectly fine.


Contact Heading for 2 lines
Line 1: Email | Phone
Line 2: GitHub | LinkedIn | Location

Here location is not mandatory, can be removed to avoid bias it is only useful if you are applying locally.




Use en-dash(big hyphen) (–) between dates for ranges, e.g., Mar 2020 – Dec 2022

You can use a small logo in the header section for mobile no, linked, etc.


Profession summary - 2 to 3 lines max including skills, training, experience, objective

GitHub link - right aligned is best. GitHub link name labels - GitHub Repository > GitHub Link

Job location should be all over India to first get interview calls from LinkedIn and Naukri. First most important things is to getting the experience of Test and Interview.




Adding generic soft skills like "Problem-solving • Communication will actually make your resume look cheaper than your thinking that it will help.              Why? shows inexperience, seems filler, takes away focus.        technical skills + projects = interviews.

Focus Your Energy Instead On:
Building that project - this will triple your resume's impact
Polishing your GitHub profile
Writing a good project description

The magic happens in the Projects section - that's where you'll stand out from other candidates.
